## Implementation Guide

### üîÑ Rebalancing Triggers and Action Matrix

| **Trigger Type** | **Condition** | **Action Required** | **Priority** |
|------------------|---------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **MVRV Zone Change** | Crosses 0.5 interval boundary | Adjust to new zone allocation | High |
| **Threshold Breach** | Any position ¬±5% from target | Rebalance to target | Medium |
| **Lifecycle Transition** | Every 5 years | Shift to next phase allocation | High |
| **Annual Review** | Calendar year-end | Full portfolio rebalance | Low |
| **Extreme MVRV** | <0.8 or >3.5 | Emergency defensive/offensive shift | Critical |

### Implementation Best Practices

1. **Tax-Efficient Execution**
   - Use tax-advantaged accounts when possible
   - Harvest losses during rebalancing
   - Time rebalancing for optimal tax treatment

2. **Dollar-Cost Averaging**
   - Systematic entry during accumulation phases
   - Regular contributions to preferred instruments
   - Avoid lump-sum entries during high MVRV periods

3. **Monitoring Schedule**
   ```
   Daily: MVRV ratio check
   Weekly: Position drift analysis
   Monthly: Performance review
   Quarterly: Full allocation assessment
   Annually: Lifecycle adjustment
   ```

## Risk Management

### üéØ Portfolio Objectives

- **Return Target**: 75% optimization (not maximum returns)

## Quick Start

### üöÄ Getting Started in 3 Steps

   ```
   Age 20-30: Aggressive Growth (Years 1-5)
   Age 30-40: Balanced Growth (Years 6-15)
   Age 40-50: Conservative Growth (Years 16-25)
   Age 50+: Capital Preservation (Years 25+)
   ```

2. **Check Current MVRV**
   - Visit [ChainExposed MVRV](https://chainexposed.com/MVRV.html)
   - Note current MVRV ratio
   - Find corresponding allocation in table above

3. **Implement Allocation**
   ```
   Example: 35-year-old investor, MVRV = 1.8
   - Phase: Balanced Growth
   - MVRV Zone: Mid-Cycle (1.5-2.0)
   - Allocation: 45% MSTR, 25% STRK, 25% STRF, 5% STRD
